Project is (probably) complete now! I was worried I wouldn't be able to finish before it was too late, but I got it finished the thursday before the extension period was over!

The code is set up to read from a database named "hot_iss_tables". It connects using a user named "root" with no password. User login credentials for both admin and non-admin are shown on the login page!
